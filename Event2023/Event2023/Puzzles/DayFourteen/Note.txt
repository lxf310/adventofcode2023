Pick's theorem: Suppose we have a polygon with integer coordinates with area A,
B integer points along its boundary, and I integer points strictly within.
Then A = I + (B/2) - 1.

The solution to the problem is just I+B, the number of grid points / squares in the shape,
plus the number of squares/points on the inside of the shape.
Rearranging, Pick's theorem tells us I = A - (B/2) + 1.
So I+B = A + (B/2) + 1.
B is just the perimeter - the sum of N across all commands.
(note: each command actually covers N+1 squares, but the ending square of each command is also covered by the
 starting square of the next command. So summing N gets the correct number of squares in the path)
We can compute the area A in two different ways:
- The shoelace formula: A = (\sum X[i]*Y[i+1] - X[i+1]*Y[i]) // 2
- Green's theorem: A = \sum y * dx = \sum x * dy
